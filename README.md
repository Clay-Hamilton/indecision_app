Building a decider app in React.

I'm working through Andrew Mead's Udemy course on React, which involves building an app to help you make decisions.
In the final project, you can add a number of options you are choosing between, then the program will randomly choose one option for you to do.

So far, I have worked on:
- setting up a React workspace with Visual Studio Code to write/edit, babel to convert from JSX to JS, and live-server to run a temporary web server
- using ternary operators and arrow functions - implicitly returning objects
- rewriting the program to utilize React Components
- utilizing interpolated strings
- props and state for React components and passing data through them
- converting to stateless functional components when possible
- using lifecycle methods to save to/retrieve from local storage with JSON

TODO next:
- incorporate Webpack module bundler
- fold in React-Modal for better alert event handling
- style program with SCSS
